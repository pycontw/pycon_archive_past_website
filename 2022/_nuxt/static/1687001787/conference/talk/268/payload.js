The basic elements of social systems are human beings, and the mutual social bonds of human beings in the social system a.k.a. the stock market in our example, perpetually changes in the sense of the ongoing reconfiguration of the structure of the stock market. The stock market is the emergence of human beings in the end.\r\n\r\nAny kind of community is also the emergence of the human beings, including the community to organize a community conference.\r\n\r\nI have volunteered to organize a regional [PyCon](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.python.org\u002Fpsf\u002Ftrademarks\u002Fpycon\u002F), PyCon Taiwan, for years.
