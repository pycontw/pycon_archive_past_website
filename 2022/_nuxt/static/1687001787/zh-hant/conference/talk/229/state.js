(As for the hardware, it is a future work)\r\n\r\nI defined Shion v0.0.1 as a program that enables the following:\r\n\r\n1. We inputs voice into Shion (the program)\r\n2. Shion transcribes speech into text\r\n3. Shion processes the text\r\n4. Shion reads the text out loud as response\r\n\r\nText processing is also worth devising, but this time the focus is on handling speech.\r\n\r\n## Techniques to implement Shion\r\n\r\n- Text-To-Speech enables a program to read text out loud\r\n- Automatic Speech Recognition enables us to input voice into a program\r\n\r\n### Text-To-Speech (a.k.a TTS)\r\n\r\n- call OS command [1] (easy to implement, but depends on the environment)\r\n- use a pre-trained machine learning model\r\n\r\n[1]: call `say` command (macOS) like https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.python.org\u002F3\u002Fhowto\u002Flogging-cookbook.html#speaking-logging-messages\r\n\r\n### Automatic Speech Recognition (a.k.a ASR)\r\n\r\n- call API like Cloud Speech-to-Text API [2]\r\n- use a pre-trained machine learning model (to provide this feature without Internet access. Shion is standalone)\r\n\r\n[2] https:\u002F\u002Fcloud.google.com\u002Fspeech-to-text\r\n\r\n# Caveats\r\n\r\n⚠️Mainly deals with ASR and TTS in Japanese. Best effort for ASR and TTS in English.  \r\n⚠️I am a beginner of ASR and TTS, so the focus will be on what implementations are possible.
