Do you want to handle a large dataset using pandas? Do you want to develop the Python code on your laptop and run it on Cloud or Kubernetes effortlessly?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I assume you are familiar with pandas and I will share how to distribute your pandas ETL job by changing few lines of code(even just one).";a.detailed_description="If you are working in Data Science field, pandas is a fantastic tool for Python users. According to the offical document, **pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language**. However, every tools have limitations. pandas can manipulate small data efficiently because it handle the data in memory, which means it's difficult to process large datasets.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will share two common cases describing how to distribute your pandas ETL job by changing few lines of code(even just one):\r\n- Handling many small datasets which share the same ETL logic\r\n- Handling an out-of-core dataset without re-write the ETL script\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n- [Ray](https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.ray.io\u002Fen\u002Flatest\u002F)\r\n- [Modin](https:\u002F\u002Fmodin.readthedocs.io\u002Fen\u002Flatest\u002F)";a.slide_link="https:\u002F\u002Fwww.slideshare.net\u002FAndrewLi55\u002Fdistributing-your-pandas-etl-job-using-modin-and-raypdf";a.slido_embed_link="https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002FeTKYkMG74iDjguzjGL2ELM";a.hackmd_embed_link="https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002FH1NcUpQki";a.speakers=[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Ftemp\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002F15\u002F41\u002F1541b71990b958dd8091f95200c1c3c9.jpg",name:"李泓旻 (Andrew)",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Forcahmlee",twitter_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Forcahmlee",facebook_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.facebook.com\u002Forcahmlee",bio:"I am currently working as a data engineer in the financial industry.
