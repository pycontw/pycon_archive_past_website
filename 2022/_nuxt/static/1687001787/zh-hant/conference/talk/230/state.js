Whether you want to start contributing or just want to get a better understanding of Python by exploring its source code, it’s often difficult to know where to start or what you’re missing.\r\n\r\nIn my talk, I will take you through Python's internals by showing you how to implement a new operator, a pipe operator. This will take us on a journey that touches upon all the steps necessary to execute a Python application, from parsing source code to evaluating bytecode.\r\n\r\nBy the end, you will have a general understanding of how Python executes code and the mental frameork to dive into more comprehensive resources, like the excellent [Python Developer’s Guide](https:\u002F\u002Fdevguide.python.org\u002F) and Anthony Shaw's [CPython Internals](https:\u002F\u002Frealpython.com\u002Fproducts\u002Fcpython-internals-book\u002F).\r\n\r\nMy talk is aimed at everyone who wants to explore CPython’s internals. You don’t have to be an expert in Python, although some affinity with Python helps with understanding the internals. I will also use C to implement some of the operator logic, but knowledge of C is by no means required. In short, if you’re interested in diving into the CPython source code, this talk is for you.",slide_link:c,slido_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002F4u3ARAHdFep9SSeVgb6Smr",hackmd_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002FSyOpLpmkj",speakers:[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Ftemp\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002Fb7\u002Fbf\u002Fb7bf9f198923de07f32b9a19836aaa3a.jpg",name:"Sebastiaan Zeeff",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002FSebastiaanZ",twitter_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002FSebastiaanZeeff",facebook_profile_url:c,bio:"Sebastiaan is a Software Engineer for the Ordina Pythoneers and a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation.
