It takes a machine that understands the semantics of human languages and equipts with mathematic skills to solve the equations desribed with natural languages.\r\n\r\nAs Loki NLU engine provides accurate semantic parsing result and SymPy is good at solving equations, I'd love to share my experience of using Loki NLU engine to convert math word problems into equations, then solve them with SymPy. The beauty of these two tools is that they are both Python-based and it only takes basic Python skills to build the math word problem solver.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, I present a simple comparison of NLU systems and their joy and tears (mostly tears) while dealing with math word problems. Then, the hybrid NLU system, Loki, is used to convert math word problems into equations. Finally, I introduce SymPy and how to use it to solve the equations to get the answer of the problem.",detailed_description:"Mainstring math word problem solving procedures take this issue as an \"**Alignment Problem**\" or a \"**Searching Problem**.\" Both appraoches can only get approximately 60% (more or less) accuracy.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Loki (Linguistic Oriented Keyword Interface) is a hybrid NLU system that has both rule-based ***Structural Pattern Matching*** module and a ML-based synonym module to provide way much accurate NLP\u002FNLU accuracy and thus a better conversion between natural language and math equations.\r\n\r\nWe have done this with Loki on Chinese math word problems and written a paper on this topic.
