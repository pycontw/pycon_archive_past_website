Shall the Python and open-source communities be concerned?",detailed_description:"### Background:\r\n\r\nAfter researchers at the University of Cambridge published [a paper](https:\u002F\u002Ftrojansource.codes\u002Ftrojan-source.pdf) about a malicious attack named Trojan Source, which exploited the fact that some program interpreters, like CPython, can handle Unicode. This has caused concerns in the open-source community about the malicious contribution that looks totally legitimate in human eyes but contain invisible attacks. As a member of the Python community, we should all be aware of that and understand how we can prevent this attack to happen.\r\n\r\n### About this talk:\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Cheuk will decode the finding in this paper to a level that can be understood by everyone. She will start with a joke example who you can mess up someone by using Unicode. She will then explain what is Unicode and why it causes trouble. Afterwards, she will explain the [Python examples](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fnickboucher\u002Ftrojan-source\u002Ftree\u002Fmain\u002FPython) in the paper and why it can be dangerous. Lastly, she will open up a discussion on how we should defend ourselves from those attacks and what we can do as a community.",slide_link:b,slido_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002F1KMf9S167YGfLtQPu3hxLv",hackmd_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002FryO9Amwki",speakers:[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Ftemp\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002Ffb\u002Fe0\u002Ffbe015320d555add14d79fc6f39c1aac.jpg",name:"Cheuk Ting Ho",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002FCheukting",twitter_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fcheukting_ho",facebook_profile_url:b,bio:"Before working in Developer Relations, Cheuk has been a Data Scientist in various companies which demands high numerical and programmatical skills, especially in Python.
